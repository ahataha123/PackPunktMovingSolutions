# Demo Umzugsservice (Static)

This is a small static prototype inspired by diemoebelpacker.at.

How to view

Open `website/index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can run:

```
start "" "website/index.html"
```

What I included

- `index.html` — responsive hero, form card and features
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styles
- `assets/img/*.svg` — small SVG placeholders for logo, sofa and icons

Next steps (optional)

- Replace SVGs with real photography
- Integrate a contact form backend (Netlify Forms, Formspree, or simple server)
- Add accessibility improvements and localization
